# Human Resources Web Application
 A simple web application for human resources departments to use. New jobs can be posted, updated or deleted while applicants can register, apply, get informed about the result of their applications. Spring Boot, Maven, Thymeleaf, LDAP, Scribe, Oauth2, LinkedIn API, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, various Spring libraries such as Session, Mail, Security and Social were used.

This was my first project as a full-stack developer and I developed this web application in 2018 during my internship at Open Business Software Solutions and got hired at the same company later on, thanks to this project.
